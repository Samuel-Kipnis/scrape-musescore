# MuseScore Automated Search & Download

This is a set of python scripts that search for and download sheet music on MuseScore.com using a CSV file.

### Features

- Automatically dynamically logs in to MuseScore.com using saved cookies
- Searches for sheet music on MuseScore.com using a CSV file of queries,returns a json file of found and free to download results of searches
- Downloads sheet music files in the json file generated by search

### Usage

- This folder already contains a FinalistPiecesCSV.csv and finalist_sheet_music_results.json file,  which is the one used by me initially, included for convenience when sharing with others who needed it. Replace the csv with your own, and when you run the mass_search.py, the json file will be overwritten.

1. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
2. Create or import a CSV file with composer and piece as the columns, either rename the csv to FinalistPiecesCSV.csv or change the file in scripts/mass_search.py.
3. Each musescore account can only download 20 pieces per day, so if you need to create an account for every 20 pieces you need to download.
4. Once you have made the accounts, run "python ./dump_cookies.py {insert_account_here}", sign in, and press enter in the terminal for each account in use (number of accounts needed is the number of pieces needed to be downloaded divided by 20)
5. Next, run "./scripts/mass_search.py", which searches through MuseScore and saves free to download result pages for each piece. The search results will be saved to a JSON file "finalist_sheet_music_pieces.json"
6. Finally, run "./scripts/mass_download.py", which will dynamically log in to an account, download 20 files, and repeat. (IMPORTANT: make sure there are enough accounts to download all the files)
